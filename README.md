# Three-Way Invoice Matching System

A sophisticated multi-agent system for automated three-way matching in accounts payable, built with AutoGen v0.7.5 and Streamlit.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations process thousands of vendor payments requiring verification of:
- Purchase Order existence and approval
- Goods Receipt confirmation
- Invoice amount/quantity matching with PO and GR

Manual matching is error-prone and can miss:
- Fraud (fake invoices, overbilling)
- Process failures (paying without receiving goods)
- Data entry errors (wrong quantities/prices)

## 🏗 Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
The system uses AutoGen v0.7.5 to orchestrate five specialized agents:

1. **DataMapperAgent** - Analyzes CSV structures and creates column mappings
2. **QueryAgent** - Translates natural language to pandas operations on raw data
3. **MatchingAgent** - Executes three-way matching logic and identifies exceptions
4. **AnalysisAgent** - Performs pattern analysis and risk assessment
5. **ReportAgent** - Generates comprehensive audit reports

### Data Flow
```
 CSVs Upload → Data Mapping → Query Translation → Three-Way Matching → Pattern Analysis → Report
      ↓             ↓               ↓                    ↓                   ↓              ↓

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd invoice-matcher
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

4. Generate sample data
```bash
python data_generator.py
```

5. Launch the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 Features

### Natural Language Querying
- "Find all invoices without purchase orders"
- "Show me price variances over 15%"
- "Which vendors have the most exceptions?"

### Exception Detection
- **NO_PO**: Invoices without purchase orders (fraud indicator)
- **NO_GR**: Invoices without goods receipts (premature payment)
- **QTY_MISMATCH**: Invoice quantity exceeds received quantity (overbilling)
- **PRICE_VARIANCE**: Price differences exceeding threshold
- **DUPLICATE**: Duplicate invoice detection

### Reusable Control Tests
Pre-configured audit tests that can be saved and rerun:
- Missing PO Check
- Price Variance >10%
- Duplicate Invoice Detection
- Quantity Overbilling
- Missing Goods Receipt

### Transparency & Audit Trail
- Step-by-step reasoning display
- Complete processing audit trail
- Data lineage tracking
- Reproducible results

### Risk Assessment
- Vendor risk profiling
- Financial exposure calculation
- Exception prioritization by severity
- Temporal pattern analysis

## 📊 Sample Data Generation

The `data_generator.py` creates realistic test data with controlled mismatches:

- **500 Purchase Orders** with vendor, item, quantity, price details
- **450 Goods Receipts** linked to POs
- **480 Invoices** with controlled exceptions:
  - 380 perfect matches (baseline)
  - 30 invoices without matching PO
  - 25 invoices with quantity overbilling
  - 20 invoices with price variance >10%
  - 15 duplicate invoices
  - 10 invoices without goods receipt

## 🖥 User Interface

## 🤖 Agent Details

### DataMapperAgent
Analyzes uploaded CSVs to identify:
- Column purposes and data types
- Join keys between tables
- Data quality issues
- Mapping recommendations

### MatchingAgent
Performs core matching with:
- Invoice to PO matching
- PO to GR verification
- Exception identification

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### Matching Thresholds
Configure in `matcher.py`:
```python
ThreeWayMatcher(
    price_variance_threshold=0.10,  # 10% price variance
    qty_variance_threshold=0.05     # 5% quantity variance
)
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run sample queries:
```python
# Test individual components
python agents.py  # Tests agent orchestration
python matcher.py # Tests matching logic
python data_generator.py # Generates test data
```

## 📝 Sample Queries

- "Find all invoices without purchase orders"
- "Show me duplicate invoices"
- "Find invoices with price variance over 10%"
- "Which vendors have the most exceptions?"
- "Show all critical risk exceptions"
- "Find quantity mismatches"
